# Day 2 – Python Decision Making (if-elif-else)

## Overview
On Day 2 of my Data Science learning journey, I focused on **decision-making in Python** using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.  
I built a **Student Result System** that takes student details and marks, calculates the percentage, determines pass/fail status, and assigns grades.

This day helped me understand how programs make logical decisions based on conditions.

##  Objectives
- Understand and use `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Apply comparison operators (`>=`, `<`, etc.)
- Build logic for **Pass / Fail**
- Implement a **grading system**
- Practice clean and readable Python code
- Run programs using the VS Code terminal

##  Concepts Learned
- Decision making in Python
- Conditional statements
- Comparison operators
- Logical flow (top-to-bottom execution)
- Formatting output using f-strings
- Writing real-world style programs

## Project: Student Result System

### Features:
- Takes student name, course/semester, and student ID
- Accepts marks for multiple subjects
- Calculates total marks and percentage
- Determines:
  - Pass or Fail
  - Grade (A+, A, B+, B, C, D, F)
- Displays a clean and professional result output
