# Day 4 – Loops in Python

## Description
On Day 4 of my Data Science journey, I learned about **loops in Python**. Loops are used to repeat tasks efficiently and are essential for data processing, analysis, and machine learning workflows.

##  Topics Covered
- for loop
- while loop
- range() function
- break and continue statements
- Looping through lists
- Practical examples using loops

## Key Learnings
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Iterating over data structures
- Applying conditions inside loops
- Writing clean and efficient logic

## Mini Project
**Student Marks Analysis**
- Count total students
- Identify pass and fail students
- Calculate average marks using loops

## Importance in Data Science
- Used for data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Dataset iteration
- Model training loops
