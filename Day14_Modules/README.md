# Day 14: Python Modules & Project Structure

## Objective
Learn professional Python project organization using modules,
following real data science practices.

## Structure
### Basic Practice
- basic_math.py → math helper functions
- stats_analysis.py → statistical calculations
- file_utils.py → file handling utilities
- main_basic.py → module usage demo

### Mini Project: Student Analysis
- data_loader.py → loads data from file
- analysis.py → performs calculations
- report.py → prints results
- main.py → runs the project
- students.txt → raw data

## Concepts Covered
- Custom modules
- Importing between files
- Separation of concerns
- Data pipelines
- Real-world project structure

## Outcome
After Day 14, I can:
- Build multi-file Python projects
- Organize code professionally
- Work with file-based datasets
- Think like a data scientist
