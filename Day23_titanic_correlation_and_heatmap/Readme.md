# Day 23 – Titanic Correlation & Heatmap Analysis

##  Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset, focusing on correlation analysis and heatmap visualization.
The goal is to understand feature relationships before applying machine learning models.

---

##  Objectives

- Compute correlation matrix
- Visualize correlations using heatmap
- Identify multicollinearity
- Analyze relationships between survival and other features

---

##  Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

---


## Key Concepts Covered

- Correlation
- Pearson Correlation
- Correlation Matrix
- Heatmap
- Multicollinearity
- Feature Analysis

---

## Why This Matters

- Correlation analysis is a crucial step in:
- EDA → Feature Selection → Model Building → Evaluation
- Understanding feature relationships improves model performance and interpretability.

---

##  Interview Highlights

- Explain correlation range (-1 to +1)
- Explain multicollinearity impact
- Mention Pearson correlation
- Explain why correlation is checked before ML
- Clarify that correlation does not imply causation

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates statistical understanding, visualization skills, and 
practical ML preparation techniques using a real-world dataset.
